// Post an issue-ready verdict, apply `ready-for-ai`, and record that the AI did it — ⚠ in one step.
//
// ⚠ **This is the only way the label may be applied by the AI**
//   (`.claude/rules/owner-decisions.md` § `ready-for-ai`).
//   ⚠ **`gh issue edit --add-label` skips the record, ⚠ and the record is the only thing that
//   ⚠ lets anyone tell the AI's labels from the owner's** (`label-eval.mjs`).
//
// ⚠ **Grounds for doing all three in one step: a rule every call site has to remember is not a
//   ⚠ rule, it is a hope** (`.claude/rules/security.md` says the same about redaction).
//   ⚠ **Post-then-label-then-record, as three commands, would drift apart on the first busy day.**
//
// ## Usage
//
//   node .claude/tools/ready-for-ai.mjs --issue 1 --verdict-file <path>
//   node .claude/tools/ready-for-ai.mjs --issue 1 --verdict-file <path> --dry-run
//
// ⚠ **`--dry-run` writes nothing, posts nothing and labels nothing.** ⚠ **It runs every refusal
//   check and says what it would have done** — ⚠ **so the checks can be exercised without
//   touching a public repository.**
//
// ## ⚠ What it refuses, and why a refusal is an answer
//
//     the issue is CLOSED             ⚠ never touch something already finished
//     needs-decision is present       ⚠ the owner has not decided
//     the verdict does not say YES    ⚠ the gate already said no
//     a named dependency is open      ⚠ the work could be started and not finished
//     the label is already there      ⚠ nothing to do (⚠ and nothing to record)
//
// ⚠ **A refusal is not an obstacle to work around.** ⚠ **Never re-run it with the check removed,
//   ⚠ and never fall back to `gh issue edit`.**
//
// ⚠ **It never removes a label.** ⚠ **Applying and removing are not symmetric** — ⚠ **removing one
//   the owner applied would override the owner.**
//
// Exit: 0 when the label is present at the end (applied now, or already there), 1 on a refusal
// or an error.
