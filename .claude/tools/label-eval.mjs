// Count who applied `ready-for-ai`, and how often the gate said no.
//
// ⚠ **This is not scoring.** ⚠ **Observation only** (same contract as `telemetry-eval.mjs`).
// ⚠ **Read-only.** ⚠ **It writes nothing, and it never applies or removes a label.**
//
// ## ⚠ What changed, and why it had to
//
// ⚠ **This used to subtract.** ⚠ **Total applications, minus what a local file said the AI did,
//   ⚠ and the remainder was called the owner's.** ⚠ **That was an inference wearing a number.**
//
// ⚠ **The reason it had to be: `gh` acts as the repository owner, so the timeline's actor is the
//   ⚠ owner whoever pressed the button.** ⚠ **And a file on one laptop cannot know about an
//   ⚠ application made anywhere else** — ⚠ **its silence about one is indistinguishable from that
//   ⚠ one not happening** (`.claude/rules/evidence.md`).
//
// ⚠ **So the AI now leaves its mark in the same timeline the question is asked of**
//   (`APPLIED_BY_AI_LABEL`). ⚠ **The timeline is complete for this repository.**
//   ⚠ **An application with no mark beside it is an observed absence, not a subtraction.**
//
// ## ⚠ What is observed, and what is still not
//
//     observed    every `ready-for-ai` application, from the timeline
//     observed    which of them carry the AI's mark
//     observed    which of them do not          ⚠ the owner's, and this is now measured
//     ⚠ NOT observed  applications made before the mark existed  ⚠ reported apart, as their own row
//     ⚠ NOT observed  refusals                 ⚠ they leave no trace on GitHub; ⚠ local record only
//
