// The label names, and where an application of `ready-for-ai` is recorded (⚠ **this one place**).
//
// ⚠ **Two tools and four documents talk about the same string.**
//
//     .claude/tools/ready-for-ai.mjs   applies the label, and appends the record
//     .claude/tools/label-eval.mjs     reads the record back, and the timeline it is compared to
//     .claude/rules/owner-decisions.md states when the label may be applied
//     .claude/skills/{issue-ready,loop-controller}/SKILL.md   run the gate around it
//
// ⚠ **The two tools import from here.** ⚠ **The documents cannot import anything.**
//   ⚠ **So `docs-check.mjs` case `ready-for-ai-label-line` asserts that the rule file actually
//   ⚠ names the string declared below** — ⚠ **renaming the label in one place alone fails.**
//   ⚠ **Same shape as `telemetry-dir.mjs` and the `.gitignore` line**, and for the same reason:
//   ⚠ **two copies of one decision drift silently unless something mechanical holds them together.**
//
// ⚠ **The record lives in the telemetry directory**, so it inherits that directory's properties:
//   ⚠ **it never enters git, and not one byte of it leaves this machine** (see `.gitignore`).
//
// ⚠ **The record is what makes "who applied this label" answerable at all.**
//   ⚠ **`gh` acts as the repository owner's account, so GitHub's own timeline shows the same
//   ⚠ actor whether a human clicked it or the AI called the API.**
//   ⚠ **Without a local record there is nothing to subtract, and the question is unanswerable.**
//   ⚠ **See `label-eval.mjs` for what that still cannot show.**
